wifi sequence
Connect WiFi at Power On

** repeat for next SSID
Trying to connect to SSID1
*** repeat next 3 lines - this is in event handler
Connect WiFi after disconnection
retry to connect to the AP
connect to the AP fail 

failed to connect to SSID
returning from connecting 2 wifi


What is happening
1 Try 3 times
2 try 3 times
3 try 3 times

what clients needs
Try 1
Try 2
Try 3

Try above sequence for 10 times



Challenge -once wifi disconnected, it does not sense that and change status
s2pinit if added will set a test output , normally keep it off
UART2 not yet tested/not working
wifi/server disconnection to be tested

have variable size pulses - done

020524T1


010524T2
small bug of CA values correctd
capture multiple pulses
Tested by Prashant


010524T1
adding memorising CA and totals parameters
working 


300424T2
send reply to server when input pulse sensed -worked
send totals is now two command *TV and *TC
*TC for cash
*TV for V commands
(6603 V command becomne Coins for 6666)


300424T1
Added *CA:pulsewidth:PolarityCommand)
polarity 0 means active low output
polarity 1 means actibe high output
working
Input pulses being senses



210424
When V command is received pulse L1
when coin are sensed pulse L2
when reply is sent pulse L3

output pins configured
CH 1/ CH5 tested
CH 3 pulses okay but low voltage
CH 7 pulses okay but low voltage
CH 4 okay
CH 2 okay



190424
*V:TID:Plan:Pulses#
skip duplicate TID
*TC?# added

180424
blink one LED when packet received
Blick second LED when HBT Sent
*HBT,MACID#
160424C

addimg *FW?#
160424B Led command being added, Jumper sense added
*SL:x:y# added, set light x is 1/2/3 y is 0/1
160424A - SIP command tested
090324A - *GP1:7# working okay
070324B - decode x and y from *GP:x:y# and then generate pulses
070324A - get command from server *GP:x:y# where x is pin and y is number of pulses
change *Tx:y# to *TP:x:y#
060324C -count number of pulses within two second and send to server as *Px:y# where x is pin number and y is pulses
060324B -count number of pulses within one second
060324A - send pulse sense to socket send *Px# where x is number
060324 - check led styles
led blinks 1/2/3/4 times every 2 seconds as per status. This makes it easy to detect status. 
fast/slow blink does not work 
input sense working well and displaying status when input pin changes status

020324D -socket does not work with vending-iot.com but works with 163.232.177.23
able to connect and send MAC address
Checked with nc - l 6666 command
also data sent from server is received and displayed on ESP_LOGI

020324D - working 4094 and 3 LEDs test mode 020324D
020324C - working 4094 test mode 020324C
